AI Chatbot with Flask and OpenRouter Mistral 7B

A web-based AI chatbot built using a Flask backend (app.py) and OpenRouterâ€™s Mistral 7B model. The Flask app handles REST API requests from the frontend, forwarding user messages to the OpenRouter API and returning AI-generated replies.
Features include real-time chat, speech-to-text input, text-to-speech responses, dark mode toggle, chat clearing, and a clean, responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project showcases integrating advanced AI language models into modern web apps for interactive user experiences.
